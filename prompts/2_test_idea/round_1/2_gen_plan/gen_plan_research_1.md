title: Percolation Threshold Readability Model
hypothesis: >-
  Text readability can be quantified as the percolation threshold of a cohesion network constructed from the text. As a reader
  processes a text, they build a mental network where sentences/concepts are nodes and cohesion links (lexical overlap, semantic
  similarity, referential ties) are edges. Readability equals the critical fraction of cohesion links needed for a giant connected
  component to emerge in this network. Texts with low percolation thresholds are easy to read because concepts integrate quickly;
  texts with high thresholds are hard because concepts remain fragmented until late in processing.
motivation: >-
  Current readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, BERT-based models) measure surface features or use black-box predictions,
  but they don't model the underlying cognitive process of how readers integrate information. Percolation theory from statistical
  physics provides a natural model: reading comprehension is the process of building a connected mental model. The percolation
  threshold precisely captures how easily this model integrates. This gives a physically interpretable readability metric
  grounded in how the brain actually processes cohesive text.
assumptions:
- >-
  Reader comprehension involves building a connected mental network of concepts from the text
- >-
  Cohesion links (lexical overlap, semantic similarity, reference) correspond to edges in the reader's mental network
- >-
  The ease of comprehension correlates with how quickly the mental network percolates (forms a giant component)
- >-
  The percolation threshold of the text's cohesion network is a measurable proxy for this cognitive integration difficulty
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Construct cohesion networks from English texts: nodes = sentences, edges = cosine similarity of sentence embeddings (SBERT)
  + lexical overlap. 2. Compute percolation threshold by simulating edge addition in random order and measuring when giant
  component emerges (reaches 50% of nodes). 3. Compare percolation threshold against gold-standard readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid,
  human ratings from Newsela/OneStopEnglish datasets). 4. Test whether percolation threshold predicts reading comprehension
  scores better than traditional formulas. 5. Ablate: test with/without semantic edges to isolate effect of cohesion vs. just
  lexical overlap.
success_criteria: >-
  1. Percolation threshold should correlate negatively with established readability scores (easy texts have low thresholds).
  2. Percolation threshold should explain variance in human readability ratings beyond traditional formulas (significant delta
  R²). 3. On sentence-level readability datasets (Weebit, Newsela), percolation threshold should achieve RMSE < 1.5 grade
  levels when used as a feature in a simple linear model. 4. The method should be robust: threshold should be similar across
  multiple random edge-ordering runs (std < 0.05).
related_works:
- >-
  Zhang et al. (2026) 'Automatic text readability assessment for educational content based on graph representation learning'
  (Scientific Reports) - Uses Graph Convolutional Networks on POS-based dependency graphs. Our approach differs fundamentally:
  we use percolation theory to model the DYNAMIC process of comprehension (when does the mental model connect?) rather than
  static graph classification. GCNs learn to predict readability from graph structure; we derive an interpretable physical
  parameter (percolation threshold) that directly models cognitive integration.
- >-
  Ehret (2018) 'Kolmogorov complexity as a universal measure of language complexity' - Uses compression-based complexity.
  Our approach differs: we model TEXT AS A NETWORK and measure connectivity emergence, not information density. Kolmogorov
  complexity captures overall difficulty; percolation threshold captures specifically how fragmented vs. integrated the text
  feels.
- >-
  Cohen et al. on semantic network percolation (creativity research) - Uses k-clique percolation to measure flexibility of
  free association networks. Our work adapts percolation theory to a completely different domain (readability assessment)
  with a different network construction (text cohesion vs. free association) and a different research question (predicting
  readability vs. measuring creativity).
inspiration: >-
  Percolation theory from statistical physics (studying phase transitions in networks) crossed with discourse cohesion theory
  from linguistics. In physics, percolation threshold predicts when a material becomes conductive; in reading, we hypothesize
  it predicts when a text becomes 'comprehensible' (when the reader's mental model forms a connected whole). The key cross-domain
  insight: readability is not a static property of text but emerges from a phase transition in the reader's mental network.
terms:
- term: Percolation threshold
  definition: >-
    In network science, the critical fraction of edges that must be present before a giant connected component emerges spanning
    a significant portion of the network
- term: Cohesion network
  definition: >-
    A graph representation of text where nodes represent sentences or concepts, and edges represent cohesive ties such as
    lexical overlap, semantic similarity, or referential connections
- term: Giant connected component
  definition: >-
    A subgraph that contains a large fraction of all nodes in the network and in which any two nodes are connected by a path
- term: Phase transition
  definition: >-
    In statistical physics, a point at which a system undergoes a qualitative change in behavior (e.g., from disconnected
    to connected) as a parameter crosses a critical threshold
- term: SBERT
  definition: >-
    Sentence-BERT: a modification of BERT that uses siamese/triplet networks to produce semantically meaningful sentence embeddings
    for measuring similarity
summary: >-
  We propose that text readability equals the percolation threshold of the text's cohesion network. Easy texts have low thresholds
  (concepts connect quickly into a coherent mental model); hard texts have high thresholds (concepts remain fragmented). This
  provides a physically interpretable readability metric based on network science.

  Conduct literature review on: (1) traditional readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, Dale-Chall, SMOG, ARI), (2) modern ML
  approaches (BERT-based readability models, feature-based approaches), (3) evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in readability
  assessment research. Identify standard evaluation protocols, metrics (RMSE, correlation), and datasets used in recent papers.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for research artifacts:
  - cpu_light: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks (fallback: memory-optimized CPUs first (cpu3m → cpu5m), then GPU hosts last-ditch)

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [4] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-07-08 22:31:11 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
