<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Percolation Threshold Readability Model
hypothesis: >-
  Text readability can be quantified as the percolation threshold of a cohesion network constructed from the text. As a reader
  processes a text, they build a mental network where sentences/concepts are nodes and cohesion links (lexical overlap, semantic
  similarity, referential ties) are edges. Readability equals the critical fraction of cohesion links needed for a giant connected
  component to emerge in this network. Texts with low percolation thresholds are easy to read because concepts integrate quickly;
  texts with high thresholds are hard because concepts remain fragmented until late in processing.
motivation: >-
  Current readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, BERT-based models) measure surface features or use black-box predictions,
  but they don't model the underlying cognitive process of how readers integrate information. Percolation theory from statistical
  physics provides a natural model: reading comprehension is the process of building a connected mental model. The percolation
  threshold precisely captures how easily this model integrates. This gives a physically interpretable readability metric
  grounded in how the brain actually processes cohesive text.
assumptions:
- >-
  Reader comprehension involves building a connected mental network of concepts from the text
- >-
  Cohesion links (lexical overlap, semantic similarity, reference) correspond to edges in the reader's mental network
- >-
  The ease of comprehension correlates with how quickly the mental network percolates (forms a giant component)
- >-
  The percolation threshold of the text's cohesion network is a measurable proxy for this cognitive integration difficulty
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Construct cohesion networks from English texts: nodes = sentences, edges = cosine similarity of sentence embeddings (SBERT)
  + lexical overlap. 2. Compute percolation threshold by simulating edge addition in random order and measuring when giant
  component emerges (reaches 50% of nodes). 3. Compare percolation threshold against gold-standard readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid,
  human ratings from Newsela/OneStopEnglish datasets). 4. Test whether percolation threshold predicts reading comprehension
  scores better than traditional formulas. 5. Ablate: test with/without semantic edges to isolate effect of cohesion vs. just
  lexical overlap.
success_criteria: >-
  1. Percolation threshold should correlate negatively with established readability scores (easy texts have low thresholds).
  2. Percolation threshold should explain variance in human readability ratings beyond traditional formulas (significant delta
  R²). 3. On sentence-level readability datasets (Weebit, Newsela), percolation threshold should achieve RMSE < 1.5 grade
  levels when used as a feature in a simple linear model. 4. The method should be robust: threshold should be similar across
  multiple random edge-ordering runs (std < 0.05).
related_works:
- >-
  Zhang et al. (2026) 'Automatic text readability assessment for educational content based on graph representation learning'
  (Scientific Reports) - Uses Graph Convolutional Networks on POS-based dependency graphs. Our approach differs fundamentally:
  we use percolation theory to model the DYNAMIC process of comprehension (when does the mental model connect?) rather than
  static graph classification. GCNs learn to predict readability from graph structure; we derive an interpretable physical
  parameter (percolation threshold) that directly models cognitive integration.
- >-
  Ehret (2018) 'Kolmogorov complexity as a universal measure of language complexity' - Uses compression-based complexity.
  Our approach differs: we model TEXT AS A NETWORK and measure connectivity emergence, not information density. Kolmogorov
  complexity captures overall difficulty; percolation threshold captures specifically how fragmented vs. integrated the text
  feels.
- >-
  Cohen et al. on semantic network percolation (creativity research) - Uses k-clique percolation to measure flexibility of
  free association networks. Our work adapts percolation theory to a completely different domain (readability assessment)
  with a different network construction (text cohesion vs. free association) and a different research question (predicting
  readability vs. measuring creativity).
inspiration: >-
  Percolation theory from statistical physics (studying phase transitions in networks) crossed with discourse cohesion theory
  from linguistics. In physics, percolation threshold predicts when a material becomes conductive; in reading, we hypothesize
  it predicts when a text becomes 'comprehensible' (when the reader's mental model forms a connected whole). The key cross-domain
  insight: readability is not a static property of text but emerges from a phase transition in the reader's mental network.
terms:
- term: Percolation threshold
  definition: >-
    In network science, the critical fraction of edges that must be present before a giant connected component emerges spanning
    a significant portion of the network
- term: Cohesion network
  definition: >-
    A graph representation of text where nodes represent sentences or concepts, and edges represent cohesive ties such as
    lexical overlap, semantic similarity, or referential connections
- term: Giant connected component
  definition: >-
    A subgraph that contains a large fraction of all nodes in the network and in which any two nodes are connected by a path
- term: Phase transition
  definition: >-
    In statistical physics, a point at which a system undergoes a qualitative change in behavior (e.g., from disconnected
    to connected) as a parameter crosses a critical threshold
- term: SBERT
  definition: >-
    Sentence-BERT: a modification of BERT that uses siamese/triplet networks to produce semantically meaningful sentence embeddings
    for measuring similarity
summary: >-
  We propose that text readability equals the percolation threshold of the text's cohesion network. Easy texts have low thresholds
  (concepts connect quickly into a coherent mental model); hard texts have high thresholds (concepts remain fragmented). This
  provides a physically interpretable readability metric based on network science.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."
---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
